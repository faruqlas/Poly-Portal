# 🎓 Polytechnic Portal Roadmap

## 🏫 Vision
To provide a world-class, NBTE-compliant Student Management System (SMS) tailored for the unique administrative landscape of Nigerian private polytechnics. Our focus is on transparency, financial integrity, and academic excellence.

## 🛠 Project Status: Phase 2 (Administrative Integration)

- **Academic Lifecycle**: 
  - Course Registration with 24-unit hard limits.
  - Carry-over course prioritization (NBTE standard).
  - Results viewing with GPA/CGPA calculators.
